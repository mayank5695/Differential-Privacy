# Differential-Privacy
A part of ongoing university project called Research methodology and scientific writing. This project aims at exploring different spectrums of differential privacy and come up with an approach to make a good solution to handle differential privacy. The basis of our project is Google's research 'Deep Learning with Differential Privacy'. You can find the paper here, 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133'.

## Problem
To implement deep learning models to perform differential privacy to withhold personal information, but also make sure the resulting data comes from the same distribution.

## Hypothesis
Differential privacy can be attained by using deep learning models, by clipping the gradient in the layers of the network.
## Purpose
The purpose is to use a deep learning model to attain differential privacy, thereby encrypting the personal data from reaching out to the hands of unauthorised companies and organisations.
