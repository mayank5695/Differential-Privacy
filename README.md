# Differential-Privacy
A part of ongoing university project called Research methodology and scientific writing. This project aims at exploring different spectrums of differential privacy and come up with an approach to make a good solution to handle differential privacy. The basis of our project is Google's research 'Deep Learning with Differential Privacy'. You can find the paper here, 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133'.
